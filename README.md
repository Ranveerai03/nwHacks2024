## Inspiration
As students of the CST program at BCIT, we noticed that a large majority of our classmates transferred from another program or came back from the professional workforce to broaden their career options. Because of this, we decided to create an app that would save students the time and money of choosing a program that they end up not liking, thus wasting time and effort.

## What it does
Our app serves as a guide for upcoming post-secondary students looking for programs to apply to in university. Our users would be able to search a general topic they are interested in, such as "Computer Science" and our app will filter out all the programs that have the "Computer Science" tag.

Additionally, students who have completed the program can return to the app and write a review for future students, sharing their experience with the program and how much they enjoyed their time there.

## How we built it
We first planned out the potential pages that our app would have, using Figma. Next, we planned out how the database would store the information and how it should be structured. Then, we split up our responsibilities so that everybody would be responsible for a certain part of the project. 

## Challenges we ran into
Because our app works with a large data sample and we did not know how to use APIs to scrape websites for information, we had to do it manually by inputting the data into the database one by one. This was taking up a lot of time and because of our 24-hour time limit, we were starting to get stressed if we could end up finishing this project in time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our group consisted of four members who were participating in their first hackathon, so we were impressed with the product we were able to produce by the end of it. Additionally, even though we are from the same program, we belong to different cohorts, meaning this was the first time we ever worked on the project together as a group.

## What we learned
We learned how important it was to capitalize on each group member's strength because it allowed us to achieve something much greater than if we worked on the same thing together. 

## What's next for Scholarly
There were a lot of features we would have liked to implement but did not have the knowledge or time to do so. Some of these include:
- An API that automatically scrapes information into the database
- A server for improved security
- AI chatbot that would recommend users programs based on their preferences
- Improved Database
- Added accessibility (Languages, Light/Dark Mode, Screen Readers, etc.)
